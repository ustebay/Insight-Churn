Will they stay or will they go? Predicting worker churn

This is a project I consulted for a startup in the services industry. The startup hires service providers (i.e. workers) and then send them to clients on site (you can think of nannies, caretakers, security guards, etc.). The startup is interested in investigating worker churn. They are especially looking for ways of keeping early churners in the company. This could be done by for example giving everyone more incentives or offering extra training to the workers that are more likely to leave. For this to happen, we need to identify high risk churners and the features that are correlated with churn.
